**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the first two code cells of the file called `1-Calibration&Undistortion.py`).  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps in the fourth code cell in `Pipeline-SingleImage.ipynb`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images):

``` python
    # Threshold x gradient
    sxbinary = np.zeros_like(scaled_sobel)
    sxbinary[(scaled_sobel >= sx_thresh[0]) & (scaled_sobel <= sx_thresh[1])] = 1
    
    # Threshold color channel S
    s_binary = np.zeros_like(s_channel)
    s_binary[(s_channel >= s_thresh[0]) & (s_channel <= s_thresh[1])] = 1
    
    # Threshold color channel L
    l_binary = np.zeros_like(l_channel)
    l_binary[(l_channel >= l_thresh[0]) & (l_channel <= l_thresh[1])] = 1
```

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `Perspective_Transform()`, which appears in lines 9 through 13 of 5th code cell in the file `Pipeline-SingleImage.ipynb` .  The `Perspective_Transform()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32([[180,720],[1165,720],[725,470],[560,470]])
dst = np.float32([[180,720],[1165,720],[1165,0],[180,0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 180, 720      | 180, 720        | 
| 1165, 720      | 1165, 720      |
| 750, 470     | 1165, 0      |
| 550, 470      | 180, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear roughly parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like the image below. The code for my lane-line fitting appears in the 6th code cell in the file `Pipeline-SingleImage.ipynb` .First of all, I detect the peak index which contains most hot pixels from the warped binary image. Then accordingly number of windows are drawn and updated from bottom to up to detect the valid points within the windows. In addition, those detected points are appended to the lists called `left_lane_inds` and `right_lane_inds` and finally I used `numpy` function `np.polyfit()` to obtain corresponding coefficients.

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

To calculate the radius of curvature of the lane in meters, I did this in the 8th code cell in the file `Pipeline-SingleImage.ipynb`. Firstly, I define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters which can get how many meters per pixel in both x and y dimensions. Then the new polynomials to x,y in world space are fitted in order to the new curve coefficients in meters. Knowing all the coefficients of the polynomials equation for both lines, the radius can be easily calculated using the [equation](https://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/8-radius-curvature.php).

To calculate the position of the vehicle, assuming the camera is mounted at the center of the car, such that the lane center is the midpoint at the bottom of the image between the two lines you've detected. The code is shown below( can be found in the 8th code cell in the file `Pipeline-SingleImage.ipynb` ):
```python 
ymax = binary_warped.shape[0]
left_ba = left_fit[0]*ymax**2 + left_fit[1]*ymax + left_fit[2]
right_ba = right_fit[0]*ymax**2 + right_fit[1]*ymax + right_fit[2]
midpoint = (right_ba + left_ba)/2
offset = np.absolute((midpoint-binary_warped.shape[1]/2)*xm_per_pix)
```
The offset of the lane center from the center of the image (converted from pixels to meters) is your distance from the center of the lane.

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in the 9th code cell in the file `Pipeline-SingleImage.ipynb`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./Output_Video/project_video.mp4) The code for the project video can be checked in the file `Pipeline-Video`.

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

At the first step of this project, I mainly used many basic but terrific techniques regarding to the computer vision , such as the functions like `cv2.calibrateCamera()` and  `cv2.undistort()` in the `cv2` library to calibrate the camera mounted upon the vehicle and then to fix the original captured image. After that, the threshold will be experimented in the different color spaces and xy gradient of the image, which leads to a filtered image with most part of lane lines detected. The function, `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform()`, will then create a birdâ€™s eye view representation of the image so that more robust lane finding techniques will focus on this area of interest. There are different methods existing to find the lane lines, such as using sliding windows for both sides which results in many valid points around real lane lines being detected. 

To improve the quality of the output video and smooth the lines detected from continous frames, I did sanity check and collect the coefficients of predicted polynominal lines from previous frames in order to obtain a cleaner result and get rid of non-senese result.

It is worthwile to tune the values of threshold of different color channels and x,y gradient so that the effect of shadow and brightness could be more likely to be reduced. Also the technique of Hough transform can be used to auto create source points for the Perspective Transform. Additionally,  If lines are lost for several frames, searching from scratch using a histogram and sliding window should be performed to localize the new potential windows.
